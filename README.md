# Stock-Your-Stay

CSC 190/191 Project for our client, Mint House

Do these before doing "npm start":

1. First, make sure you are in the right directory. You want to be in the directory
   that contains the "node_modules", "public", "src" folders.
   To change directories run the command: "cd stock-your-stay". I blieve the stock-your-stay
   should be the right name of the directory directory, but it could be different when you pull it.

2. In the terminal run the command "npm install" to get the "node_module" folder.

3. Now you should be able to run the "npm start" command.

   Note: If you get an error like this: [eslint] Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json,
   then click on the package-log.json file and press ctrl + s to save it.
   Then press on the package.json file and press ctrl + s to save it. If you are still getting
   an error, let me know.

4. Now you should see a web page that just says the text "test".
